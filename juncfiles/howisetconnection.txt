having trouble with connecting node app to mysql server

firstly mysql and node both runs on localhost. So the port no should be different and have to be declared specificly.
MySql by default runs in 3306 port. Port for node can be anything.
So in node ---------------- listen port 3000
in mysql ------------------ port : 3306


for some reason (probably security, or just mysql sucks), user : root does not work
so what I did was:

in connection::


	host: "127.0.0.1",
	port: "3306",
	user: "gitpod",
	password: "newpassword"


user is the linux username. I was using gitpod. Password is the password given when adding gitpod as a user




TO SETUP :::


1. It was hard. Anyway, needed to run 

sudo su

2. for root access. Then have to start mysql service

service mysql start

3. then in mysql command (to go simply run mysql). Set new user and password

 CREATE USER 'gitpod'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'newpassword';

 4. then alter the user

 ALTER USER 'gitpod'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'newpassword';

 5. Grant all privilage

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'gitpod'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
